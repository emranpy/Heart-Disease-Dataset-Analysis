## Introduction
Heart disease is a prevalent health condition that requires a deep understanding of its underlying causes and risk factors. This repository aims to analyze a heart disease dataset using Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. By exploring the dataset and applying various analytical techniques, we can gain valuable insights into heart disease and contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.

## Dataset
The heart disease dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains anonymized patient data related to heart disease diagnosis. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and the presence of heart disease. Throughout the analysis, we will leverage these attributes to uncover patterns, correlations, and risk factors associated with heart disease.

## Installation
To get started with the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git clone https://github.com/emranpy/Heart-Disease-Dataset-Analysis.git
```
## Usage
